# Bidirectional-Search
PAC-MAN is one of the most popular game in the world. The goal of this game is to accumulate points by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze, completing that ’stage’ of the game and starting the next stage and maze of Pac-dots. There are several ghosts roaming the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts hit Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game is over.

By utilizing a problem-solving agent, we may automatically determine the shortest and most efficient routes through its maze, taking into account not only the completion of certain objectives (such as discovering all the corners) but also the consumption of all the dots. We used both uninformed search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS) and informed search algorithms (A*) in the construction of this intelligent agent. Uninformed search algorithms are provided only the problem statement. Some of these algorithms can, in principle, solve any solvable issue, but none of them can do it efficiently. As a result, we invented Bi-directional search, which performs admirably when given direction on where to hunt for answers.

Bidirectional search is another type of search algorithm in which both the starting point and the ending point are searched for in relation to the goal location. You can utilize this method with a search strategy like A* or go in blind with a BFS search. "Bidirectional Search Is Guaranteed to Meet in the Middle".
